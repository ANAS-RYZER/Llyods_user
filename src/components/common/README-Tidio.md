# Tidio Chat Integration

## Overview
This integration adds Tidio's live chat and AI customer service platform to your Next.js application.

## How it works

### 1. TidioChat Component (`src/components/common/TidioChat.tsx`)
- **Client-side component**: Uses `'use client'` directive for browser-side execution
- **Script injection**: Dynamically loads the Tidio script from their CDN
- **Duplicate prevention**: Checks if script is already loaded to prevent duplicates
- **Cleanup**: Removes script when component unmounts
- **Configurable**: Accepts a `tidioId` prop (defaults to your provided ID)

### 2. Integration in Layout (`src/app/layout.tsx`)
- Added to the root layout so it's available on all pages
- Positioned at the bottom of the body for optimal loading
- Wrapped in your existing `GlobalRyzerProvider`
